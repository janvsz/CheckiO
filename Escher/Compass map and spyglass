Your task is to count the sum of the number of steps required to pick up all 3 items - ('C' - compass), ('M' - map), ('S' - spyglass) from your starting position. So the result will be the sum of distance from Y to C, from Y to M and from Y to S (not Y-C-M-S).
Note that you can walk in 8 directions - left, right, up, down and sideways (on the diagonal in any direction). Your starting position is 'Y'.

Input: Array with the objects placements.

Output: The length of the path.

Precondition:
3x2 <= array size <= 10x10
