How old are you in a number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today. We could make this a real challenge though and count the difference between any dates.

You are given two dates as an array with three numbers - a year, month and day. For example: 19 April 1982 will be (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in days between the given dates. For example between today and tomorrow = 1 day. The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget about the absolute value.

Input: Two dates as tuples of integers.

Output: The difference between the dates in days as an integer.
